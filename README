You will also need to install:
- mksquashfs
- squashfuse
- nginx
- jq

For basic local development setup:

1) mkdir -p ~/saucery/sos
2) set SAUCERY in your env to ~/saucery
3) get the path to the 'reductions' dir in your git checkout, and do EITHER:
  a) symlink ~/saucery/reductions to it
  b) set SAUCERY_REDUCTIONS in your env to it
4) add the git checkout 'scripts' dir to your PATH

You can now use the 'saucier' command to manage sosreports placed in the
~/saucery/sos dir.

To set up the web UI:

1) install nginx
2) remove any default config in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
3) symlink, or copy, the git checkout 'nginx/saucery' file to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
4) do EITHER:
  a) edit the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/saucery file to change the 'root' to your ~/saucery dir
  b) create a symlink at /saucery to your ~/saucery dir
5) symlink, or copy, the git checkout 'web' dir to ~/saucery/web
6) restart nginx
7) edit the /etc/fuse.conf file, to uncomment the option 'user_allow_other'

You should now be able to point a web browser at your system and view the Saucery contents.

To use Saucery, add sosreport(s) to ~/saucery/sos. Then run the 'saucier' script to extract,
'sear' (process), and create a 'menu' (index for web ui); you can do all at once with:

$ saucier -ESM
